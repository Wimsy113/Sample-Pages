# Sample-Pages
A portfolio of work that I have completed. Most pages are built in HTML,  CSS, Javascript, and AngularJS

# To Check out the pages:

All you have to do is click on the folder
Click on the file you want to see
Choose the HTML file you want to view
And if you have the git hub app, you can just click the monitor up top and it'll pop up

IF you don't have the github app, you'll have to download the repo, and open it in your browser.
